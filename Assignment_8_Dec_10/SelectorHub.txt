SelectorsHub is a browser extension used by testers to easily find and write XPath and CSS selectors for web elements.
It helps automation testers by showing the correct locator without manually inspecting complicated HTML code.

SelectorsHub is used because:

It auto-generates XPath and CSS selectors for any element.
It shows all attributes, even hidden ones.
It highlights when an XPath is wrong or invalid.
It saves time in creating unique and reliable locators for Selenium automation.
It also supports Smart XPath, Relative XPath, and AI-based locator suggestions.
