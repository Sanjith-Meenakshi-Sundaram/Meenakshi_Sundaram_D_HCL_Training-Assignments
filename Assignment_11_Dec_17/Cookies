Cookies are used to store user information in the browser, and Selenium handles cookies to manage sessions, bypass login, and test application behavior effectively.

USES:
To maintain user login sessions (no need to login again).
To remember user preferences (language, theme, location).
To track user behavior for analytics and ads.
To improve website performance and user experience.

Why Cookies Need to be Handled in Selenium:

Cookies need to be handled to avoid repeated login during automation testing.
Cookies are handled to maintain user session across different test cases.
Cookies are handled to test authenticated pages without logging in every time.
Cookies are handled to clear browser data and test application behavior for a new user.
Cookies are handled to validate cookie creation, deletion, and expiry.

How to handle it:

driver.manage().getCookies() – Get all cookies
driver.manage().getCookieNamed("name") – Get a specific cookie
driver.manage().addCookie(cookie) – Add a cookie
driver.manage().deleteCookieNamed("name") – Delete a specific cookie
driver.manage().deleteAllCookies() – Delete all cookies
