TestNG supports data-driven testing using @DataProvider which allows the same test case to run multiple times with different sets of data. In JUnit, support for data-driven testing is limited and not as flexible as TestNG.
TestNG supports parallel execution of test cases through the testng.xml file. This helps in reducing overall execution time. JUnit requires additional configurations or external tools to achieve parallel execution.
TestNG provides more test configuration annotations such as @BeforeSuite, @BeforeTest, @BeforeClass, and @BeforeMethod, which give better control over the test execution flow compared to JUnit.
TestNG allows setting priority for test methods using the priority attribute, which controls the order of execution. JUnit does not support priority-based execution of test cases.
TestNG supports grouping of test cases using the groups attribute. This helps in executing specific test sets such as smoke, sanity, or regression tests. JUnit has limited support for grouping.
TestNG supports dependency between test methods, where one test method can depend on another using dependsOnMethods. This feature is not directly available in JUnit.
TestNG supports Soft Assertions, which allow multiple assertions to be executed even if one assertion fails. JUnit supports only hard assertions by default.
TestNG uses an XML configuration file (testng.xml) to control test suites, test cases, groups, and parallel execution. JUnit mainly relies only on annotations for execution control.
TestNG provides better and more detailed test reports compared to the default reports generated by JUnit.
