ArrayList and LinkedList are both used to store a group of objects, but they work internally in very different ways.
ArrayList is based on a dynamic array, which means all elements are stored in continuous memory locations.
Because of this, accessing elements using an index (like get(5)) is very fast.
However, inserting or deleting elements in the middle is slow because the remaining elements must be shifted.
On the other hand, LinkedList is built using a doubly linked list, where each element (node) stores the data along with the reference to the previous and next node.
This makes insertion and deletion very fast, especially in the beginning or middle, because it simply updates links without shifting elements.
But accessing an element by index is slow, as it has to traverse the list from the start or end.

In simple terms, you should use ArrayList when your main requirement is fast access or reading data frequently, because get and set operations are very efficient.
LinkedList should be used when your program frequently adds or removes elements from the middle or beginning of the list.
ArrayList is memory efficient, while LinkedList uses more memory due to storing extra links.
So the choice depends on the operation: choose ArrayList for fast access, choose LinkedList for fast insertions and deletions.
